# About Global South Postcards

Global South Postcards is a gallery of online postcard images from Korea and Mexico during the initial decades of picture postcard production. The gallery is meant as a comparative resource from two widely separated countries that nevertheless experienced the colonizing gaze of postcard producers and consumers in similar ways. Both were situated as incipiently modern, promising in their cultural riches and histories, yet othered and neutered, as it were, by the colonizing processes. These images show the consistency of the colonizing visual discourses to which countries in the global south were subject, regardless of the specific histories and conditions of each country.

Several developments of a technical and diplomatic nature combined to create the first postcard boom shortly after the turn of the twentieth century. On the technological front, photography and photomechanical reproduction had developed to the point where it was economically feasible to print high quality photographs on card stock, and sell them cheaply. On the diplomatic front, the establishment of an international postal agreement allowed for the mailing of postcards across international borders, and beginning in 1900 (in Korea and Mexico), postcards with printed images were allowed (contrasting with the relatively boring cards made prior to that by national postal services, which bore no image other than the stamp). These changes resulted in an immediate globalized media phenomenon, with collectors feverishly exchanging postcards from all parts of the globe, and small and large photography and printing companies producing millions of cards.
