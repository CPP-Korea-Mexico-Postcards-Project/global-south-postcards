Photograph of Ryuzan (Yongsan) railway station building completed between 1900 and 1915. Ryuzan (Yongsan) was a riverside district of Keijo (Kyung Sung), convenient to the rail bridges crossing the Han river and serving rail traffic from multiple lines. Developing Korea's railway infrastructure was a major focus of Japanese authorities. Japanese firms had been instrumental in laying the first rail lines even before Japanese colonial rule was formalized in 1910, and the Director General of Railway Bureau of the Government General of Chosen was one of the most powerful colonial officials. Postcards were issued by the Railway Bureau celebrating the wonders of modern engineering (bridges, tunnels, rail lines), the beauty spots of the Korean peninsula (with first-class hotels for rail travellers), and the fact that rail networks connected the peninsula to the exterior. Amid this headlong rush to modernize through heavy industry and transport, the european-influenced design of the Ryuzan station building (with elements reminiscent of Swiss challets and English half-timbered houses) was designed to convince the world of Korea's modernity and cosmopolitinism under Japanese rule.","Korea; Korea--Japanese Occupation, 1910-1945; Keijō (Korea); Railroads; Transportation; Modernization","Yongsan Station, Seoul, Korea",37.524664,126.958829,Cal Poly Pomona Global South Postcard Collection,KPr000_2.jpg,Image; Still Image,image/jpeg,jap; eng,No Known Copyright,http://rightsstatements.org/vocab/NoC-US/1.0/,,,,,,,,,

Colorized photograph of a gisaeng in traditional Korean Hanbok in the kitchen. Gisaeng (Kisaeng, 기생) were professional government entertainers who played an important part in the traditional culture of Korea. First appearing in the Goreyo Dynasty (918-1932), they were spread throughout the country as a distinct social group in the Joseon Dyansty (1392-1897). Gisaeng were rigorously trained in the fine arts, poetry, prose, music, and dance, and were respected for their performance as educated artists despite their low social rank. Under the Japanese rule, the official training system for gisaeng was abolished and the image of gisaeng was recreated as the object of the tourist gaze by the colonial power. The postcards of gisaeng, made and sold in sets under the name of “Chosŏn Customs,” reproduced the image of gisaeng as an exotic beauty, overemphasizing gisaeng’s sexual image and reducing the culturally significant female artists to a tourist spectacle. The postcards were mainly purchased by Japanese males who visited Korea in the 1920s but were  exported to China and other countries in Europe, too.

Mexico City, built on the bed of the ancient lake, was not fully dry until the completion of massive drainage projects in the first half of the twentieth century. The Canal de la Viga no longer exists, but during the 19th century it retained much of the colorful life and movement of the more distant Xochimilco district, famous for chinampas or floating agricultural platforms, a favorite spot for weekend excursions. Close to the city center, the Canal de la viga with its market supplied by canal boats became a much frequented paseo, or afternoon stroll, for city dwellers. Here one could watch similar waterborn commerce to that of Xochimilco--indigenous farmers in their boats, noise, color, movement, all favorite topics of costumbrista depictions.

MP0033,MPr000_33.jpg,MPv000_33.jpg,,Orquesta mexicana.,J.G. Hatton,8059,,1907-1915,"Color lithograph (halftone); ink on cardstock. Colorized photo of a small orquesta típica group playing stringed instruments such as the bandolina or bandolón (to the left), psalteries or salterios (in the center), and one of the many guitar-like instruments used throughout Mexico, variously referred to as guitarras, vihuelas and jaranas in different regions—although in this case probably a type of bass guitar such as the bajo sexto or bajo quinto (to the right). The ‘orquesta típica’ was a type of musical group that attained its classic formulation in the late-nineteenth century, during the Porfirian regime, and was associated with Mexico’s upper classes and classically-trained musicians. They were seen as acceptable representations of lo mexicano (i.e., modern, in tune with popular music elsewhere, presentable, and yet at the same time quintessentially Mexican). Orchestras such as that of Carlos Curti embarked on international tours representing Mexico at world fairs and international expositions. This small orquesta is dressed in the traje de charro, a type of regional costume associated with the landowning class—thus, aristocratic rural Mexicans, marking a clear distinction from indigenous musical groups such as that shown in MP0041. The traje de charro would not become the standard mariachi costume until some thirty years after this photograph was taken, so it is interesting to see it used here in an earlier musical setting. *Many thanks to Dr. Jessie Vallejo of the Cal Poly Pomona Music Department for the detailed information she provided about this postcard.",Mexico; Music; Charros; Orquesta tipíca; Upper class,Unknown location,23.634501,-102.552784,Cal Poly Pomona Global South Postcard Collection,MPr000_33.jpg,Image; Still Image,image/jpeg,span,No Known Copyright,http://rightsstatements.org/vocab/NoC-US/1.0/,,,,,,,,,
